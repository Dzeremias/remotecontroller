# remote controller
A microcontroller based remote control for controlling other Arduino project.
A remote control as a starting point for my other projects. 

First draft that I have in mind includes two joysticks, two rotary encoders and
a few buttons. SPI radio transmitter and small SPI display to show the control 
variables. Once i start drawing the stuff, I'll probably add some more 
controls or features to fill up Arduino's capabilities. And then I'll remove
some stuff, because I expect it to lag due to doing too much. 

I'd like to include a posibility to snap on a bigger screen some time in the 
future so that I can transfer video feed from some of my future projects. 
Most likely a completely independent thing (both power and MC-wise), but 
I'd like the main controller to support a screen between the two legs.
